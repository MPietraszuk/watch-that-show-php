There's also a nice sequence on the strength and weight training the actors went through and the stunts that are so notable in the film, as well as having to dance around the violence implicit in the story due to the planned PG-13 rating the filmmakers were aiming for.","popularity":0.2832,"poster_path":"\/2bpO6IjqcSOxICVafi9qCc6imie.jpg","release_date":"2012-08-18","title":"The World Is Watching: Making the Hunger Games","video":true,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":5,"character":"Self - Peeta Mellark","credit_id":"613679101ad93b00600a8a2a","order":2},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"\/1iut9GrFxHXFF4F6PykomPs9qwB.jpg","genre_ids":[99],"id":871533,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Surviving the Game: Making The Hunger Games: Catching Fire","overview":"An incredibly in depth and informative compendium of nine featurettes that address virtually every aspect of the film, from the adaptive process through the special effects, stunts and production design.
